    "message": "Mozilla is running a series of studies in Firefox Nightly to evaluate a service that keeps DNS providers from collecting and sharing your browsing history. All Nightly users will receive a notification about these studies. When a study is active, Nightly Firefox will automatically use Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 secure DNS over HTTPS. This study will use the Cloudflare resolver in addition to the DNS selected by a user or their ISP in order to compare approaches."

We’ve chosen Cloudflare as our partner for these studies because, unlike many other DNS providers, they agreed to strong privacy controls that include limits on what data they collect and how long they keep it, as well a promise to not share data with other parties.
